### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul Taylor, a self taught engineer from Teesside, UK, who currently works in the WordPress space as a Engineering Manager for [Big Bite](https://github.com/bigbite).

My main focus at the moment is Editorial Tooling for news outlets, where my team and I aim to ease and modernise the writing and editorial process.

I don't grace social media much, but you can find me on Mastodon at [@ampersarnie@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@ampersarnie).

If you prefer email, you can contact me at [paul.taylor@hey.com](mailto:paul.taylor@hey.com).
